# Stack Program

This program is a simple Java implementation of a **Stack Data Structure** using an ArrayList. 
It allows users to perform basic stack operations such as adding items, checking if the stack is empty, and retrieving all stack elements in the same order they were added following LIFO pronciple: last in First out. 

## Features
- **Check if the Stack is Empty**: use the isEmpty() method to verify whether the stack contains any elements;
- **Add Elements**: Add elements to the stack using the add() method;
- **Retrieve Stack Values**: get all items from the stack with the values() method.
- **Peek at the Last Element Added**: the peek() method displays the topmost element of the stack.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse or VC Code).
